If you'd prefer a more detailed report with organized sources and citations, we can use Spectrum Mode. What works best for you?'\n\n"

You can use the 'Run' button to see it in action. A special case for flask based codes make sure you serve the flask server with `if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)` only.\n\n"
